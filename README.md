# Notes
The Resolution testing jupyter notebook generates, processes, and visualizes the effects of changing the output size of the predict maps. The goal is that the visualization strategies developed in the later part of the code can be generalized and applied to other parameters, as a way to get visual intuition for what happens as you change some certain parameter.
